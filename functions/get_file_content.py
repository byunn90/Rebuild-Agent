    #  Read the file and return its contents as a string.
    #  I'll list some useful standard library functions in the tips section below.
    #  If the file is longer than 10000 characters, truncate it to 10000 characters and append this message to the end [...File "{file_path}" truncated at 10000 characters].
    #  Instead of hard-coding the 10000 character limit, I stored it in a config.py file.
    #  Use to get the contents os.listdir(): List the contents of a directory
